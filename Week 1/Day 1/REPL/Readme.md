# Python REPL & Scripting – Project Collection

This repository contains four Python programs that can be run in Python’s REPL or as standalone scripts.  
They demonstrate interactive I/O, control flow, and applying code to practical use cases.


## 1. Dice Roller
**Description:**
- Simulates rolling a dice with a custom number of sides.
- Lets the user choose how many times to roll.

**Real-World Example:**
- Can be used in board games or tabletop role-playing games when physical dice are unavailable.


## 2. Alarm Clock
**Description:**
- Takes a specific time from the user and triggers a sound or message when the time is reached.

**Real-World Example:**
- Functions as a reminder tool for short tasks such as stretching, drinking water, or meeting alerts.


## 3. Password Strength Checker
**Description:**
- Accepts a password from the user and evaluates its strength based on length, numbers, and special characters.

**Real-World Example:**
- Helps ensure stronger passwords during account creation to improve security.


## 4. Number Guessing Game
**Description:**
- Picks a random number between 1 and 50.
- The user guesses until the correct number is found, with feedback after each guess.

**Real-World Example:**
- Implements basic game logic that can be adapted for quizzes, puzzles, or interactive challenges.
