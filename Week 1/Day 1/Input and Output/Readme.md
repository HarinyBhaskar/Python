# Python Input & Output Programs

This repository contains three Python scripts that demonstrate how to use **input** (to get data from the user) and **output** (to display results) in Python.  
Each program takes user input, processes it, and prints meaningful output.


## Programs

### 1. Grade Calculator
Calculates the average of three scores entered by the user and assigns a grade.  
- **Input:** Three numeric scores from the user.  
- **Output:** Average score and corresponding grade.  


### 2. Expense Tracker
Tracks user expenses and calculates the total amount spent.  
- **Input:** Expense description and amount until the user types `done`.  
- **Output:** The total expense amount.  


### 3. Word Frequency Counter
Counts the frequency of each word in the entered text.  
- **Input:** A sentence or paragraph from the user.  
- **Output:** Dictionary showing each word and its frequency.  


## Input & Output in Action
- **Input** is collected using Python's `input()` function.  
- **Output** is displayed with Python's `print()` function.  
- These programs transform user-provided data into meaningful, real-world results.
