# FizzBuzz

This program demonstrates **control flow statements** in programming.

The program prints numbers from **1 to 100**, replacing:
- Multiples of 3 with **"Fizz"**
- Multiples of 7 with **"Buzz"**
- Multiples of both 3 and 7 with **"FizzBuzz"**
- All other numbers remain unchanged

It uses:
- **Loops** (`for`)
- **Conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
