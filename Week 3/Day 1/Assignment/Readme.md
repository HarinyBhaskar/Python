#  BankAccount Program (Python OOP)

This is a simple Python program built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

## Concepts Used
- **Class** → `BankAccount` represents a bank account.  
- **Object** → Each account created is an object of the class.  
- **Methods** →  
  - `deposit()` to add money.  
  - `withdraw()` to remove money.  
- **Exception Handling** → Prevents overdrawing (withdrawing more than the available balance).  
- **User Input** → Lets the user interact by entering deposits and withdrawals.  

## What the Program Does
- Creates a bank account for a user with an initial balance.  
- Allows the user to deposit and withdraw money.  
- Raises an error if the user tries to withdraw more than the current balance.  
- Shows the final balance when the program exits.
