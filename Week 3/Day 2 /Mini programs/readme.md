This folder contains **mini projects** built in Python to demonstrate **advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts:  
- **Inheritance** → Creating specialized classes from base ones  
- **Mixins** → Adding extra reusable functionality  


  Programs Included
1. **Airline System**  
   - Base `Flight` and derived `InternationalFlight`  
   - Mixins for ticket booking, notifications  

2. **E-commerce**   
   - Base `Product`, extended into `Electronics`, `Clothing`  
   - Mixins for discounts, order tracking  

3. **Hospital System**   
   - Base `Person`, extended into `Doctor`, `Patient`  
   - Mixins for medical records, appointment reminders  

4. **School Management**   
   - Base `Person`, extended into `Teacher`, `Student`  
   - Mixins for grading, attendance  

5. **Vehicle System**   
   - Base `Vehicle`, extended into `Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`  
   - Mixins for fuel efficiency, GPS tracking  



  Concepts:
- **Inheritance** → Reuse & extend behavior from parent classes  
- **Mixins** → Add modular, reusable features without rewriting code
